This is my solution to an assignment for Object-Oriented Programming course at the University of Warsaw (MIMUW).

### Description
The objective of this assignment was to implement a virtual stock market that simulated players and their respective buying, selling, working, and production strategies. The trading rules were dependent on the type of stock market, and the market comprised various types of items, each possessing unique properties that influenced how players could use them.
